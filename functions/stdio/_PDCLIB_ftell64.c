       - the actual *physical* offset of the file, i.e. the offset as recognized
         by the operating system (and stored in stream->pos.offset); and
       - any buffers held by PDCLib, which
         - in case of unwritten buffers, count in *addition* to the offset; or
         - in case of unprocessed pre-read buffers, count in *substraction* to
           the offset. (Remember to count ungetidx into this number.)
       Conveniently, the calculation ( ( bufend - bufidx ) + ungetidx ) results
       in just the right number in both cases:
         - in case of unwritten buffers, ( ( 0 - unwritten ) + 0 )
           i.e. unwritten bytes as negative number
         - in case of unprocessed pre-read, ( ( preread - processed ) + unget )
           i.e. unprocessed bytes as positive number.
       That is how the somewhat obscure return-value calculation works.
