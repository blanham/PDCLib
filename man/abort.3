.Sh NAME
.Nm abort
.Nd abnormal process termination

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Fn "noreturn void abort" "void"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn abort
causes abnormal process termination to occur.

.Pp
First,
.Dv SIGABRT
will be raised, as if by
.Fn raise SIGABRT .
If the signal is not being caught, or the handler which catches the signal 
returns, 
.Fn abort
will then proceed to cause the process to terminate with a failure exit status.
It is implementation defined whether any open
.Vt FILE
streams are flushed before the process exits.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
PDCLib implements termination (in the case that the 
.Dv SIGABRT
handler returns) by calling
.Fn _Exit EXIT_FAILURE .
Therefore, stream flushing rules for
.Nm
follow those defined for
.Fn _Exit .
