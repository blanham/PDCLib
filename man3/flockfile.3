.Sh NAME
.Nm flockfile, ftrylockfile, funlockfile
.Nd stdio file locking

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy #define _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 || _SVID_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE

.In stdio.h
.Fn "void flockfile" "FILE *file"
.Fn "int ftrylockfile" "FILE *file"
.Fn "void funlockfile" "FILE *file"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn flockfile
locks the passed FILE stream for access by the calling thread, potentially 
blocking. 
.Fn ftrylockfile
attempts to lock the file for the calling thread, but will return failure if
another thread has already locked the file.
.Fn funlockfile
releases the lock on the stream, allowing another thread in the process to 
access it.
.\"
.Pp
The same stream may be locked multiple times by the calling thread; the number 
of calls to 
.Fn flockfile 
and 
.Fn ftrylockfile
on a file must be equal to the number of calls to
.Fn funlockfile .
.\"
.Pp
No other thread may do I/O through the locked file while it is locked.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
PDCLib implements the file locking on top of the Mutex primitives added by C11

.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr fclose 3
.Xr unlocked_stdio 3
.Xr mtx_t 3

.Sh STANDARDS
The locked I/O routines were initially introduced in 
.St -svid4 ,
and incorporated into POSIX in 
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
