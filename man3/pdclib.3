.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library is a portable, public domain C library. It aims at full conformance with
ISO C89, C95, C99 and C11 when used in combination with a conformant compiler. 
In addition, it aims at conformance with the portion of ISO C++97 and C++2011 
which is derived from said standards.
.Pp
.Nm
aims for strict conformance with the selected C/C++ standard. Therefore, unlike
most C libraries, it does not by default expose any extensions. Some extensions
(from POSIX or the Single Unix Specification) can be selected by defining the 
appropriate feature selection macro, such as 
.Dv _POSIX_C_SOURCE
or
.Dv _XOPEN_SOURCE
to the appropriate value. For example, in the following definition:
.Bd -offset indent
.Sy #define _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
.br
.Sy #include
.In string.h
.br
.Fn "char * strdup" "const char *"
.Ed

it is documented that defining either 
.Dv _XOPEN_SOURCE
or
.Dv _POSIX_C_SOURCE
to have a value greater than
.Li 200809L
before the first inclusion of
.In string.h
will expose a definition of the function
.Fn strdup

.Sh STANDARDS
When compiled with a C compiler, conformant with 
.St -isoC-90 ,
.St -isoC-amd1 ,
.St -isoC-tcor1 ,
.St -isoC-tcor2 ,
.St -isoC-99 or
.St -isoC-2011
as dependent upon the version of C the compiler declares conformance with.
.Pp
When compiled with a C++ compiler, conformant with ISO/IEC 14882:1997 or ISO/IEC
14882:2011 "The C++ Programming Language" as dependent upon the version of C++
the compiler declares conformance with.
