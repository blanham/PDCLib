/* I did much searching as to how various people implement this.
 *
 * OpenBSD, NetBSD and Musl libc for Linux implement this as a call to wcscmp
 * and have various "todo" notices on this function, and on the other hand
 * glibc implements it as a 500 line function. FreeBSD has an implementation 
 * which kind of uses their single byte character strcoll data for the first
 * 256 characters, but looks incredibly fragile and likely to break.
 *
 * TL;DR: Nobody uses this, and this will probably work perfectly fine for you.
