 * Description of the personality concept
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

The PDCLib is aimed at providing a fully conforming implementation of the C
standard library (ISO/IEC 9899) for diverse environments.

To faciliate adaption to new environments, platform-specific parts of the
library have been seperated from the generic parts (e.g. the string functions,
or the parsing of format strings in stdio.h).

The generic part is found in includes/ and functions/. It should be compilable
on any platform given a compliant compiler.

The "personalized" part implements, for each supported environment, the non-
generic parts of the library. Each supported environment is represented by a
subdirectory (dubbed "personality module") in personalities/. Such a module
usually requires a specific compiler on a specific hardware.

The concept of personality modules was favored over the traditional approach
of '#ifdef', 'configure', and complex makefiles, because it isolates the
environment dependencies in a limited number of files in a seperate directory, instead of spreading the dependency handling all over the code base. This
approach also minimizes dependencies on the compilation environment, so that
very minimalistic environments (which could e.g. not run a 'configure' script)
could still compile the PDCLib.

A personality module consists of:

* standard '#define's and 'typedef's that are environment dependent (e.g. those
  defined in stdint.h and float.h);

* "abstract" '#define's that specify whether certain optional features are
  available in the environment or not (e.g. whether the environment supports
  the optional '_Imaginary' keyword, required in 'complex.h');

* "glue code", which binds standard library functions to support functions of
  the environment (e.g. the code actually allocating the memory passed out by
  malloc()).

* a (compiler-specific) solution for the type-generic math functions declared
  in tgmath.h.

In any case, it is sufficient to copy the contents of a personality module
(consisting of the subdirectories functions/ and includes/) into the main
directories of the same name. Your personalized copy of the PDCLib is now
ready to be compiled.

ADDING A NEW ENVIRONMENT

In the personalities/ subdirectory, you will find a module named "template". In
this module, you will find a complete description of all '#define's, 'typedef's
and glue code functions that are required to build a new personality module.

A new personality module could be kept in our repository, or in the repository
of the environment it refers to.

If you are an OS developer opting to use the PDCLib as your standard library,
you would be well-advised to keep the personality module in your own repository
since you have direct access there, and can make necessary changes yourself.
If you are not an OS developer, or your OS can be considered stable and active
enough to warrant its own personality module in the PDCLib repository, you are
free to submit it; but keep two things in mind: Any code contributed to this
project must be Public Domain, and any contribution must be reviewed by the
maintainers first. Please double-check your code before submitting.
